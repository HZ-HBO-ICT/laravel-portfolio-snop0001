        <h2 class="blog-Post"> First Feedback on my "Who Am I?" assignment:</h2>
        <br>
        <p class="blog-post">
            I received Daphne's feedback in person last week.
            Her feedback divided into two parts, one about my motivation for the studies and one about my personal development.
            About my motivation she told me it is better to focus on the story behind my love for programming and coding, which
            for me, it is the creation of something new that did not exist before, something I can see as a product and as a result
            for my effort.
            She said my personal development will be to focus on my stress and overthinking. She said it will be good for me to practice
            how to take breaks at certain hours and limit my work hours, so I can enjoy other things too and not worn myself out.
            We discussed that maybe together with my fellow students we will send a message at a certain hour obliging ourselves to take a break
            and stop working.
            I am looking forward to managing and helping myself to be more relaxed and laid back than I am right now, so I will be able to produce
            good results and succeed in my studies together with having fun and leisure time as well.
