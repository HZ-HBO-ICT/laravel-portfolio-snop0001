            <li> Cleaned up my style sheet,Cancelled repetitions (managed to narrow it down from 838 lines to 610). </li>
            <li>Making my footer not sticky but instead that it will stay at the bottom of the page.</li>
            <li>Added a logo of my name in all the pages of the website.</li>
            <li>Adjusted the design more, (mainly worked on the dashboard and FAQ to match the other pages).</li>
            <li>Added some information in the website and edited different passages to be more relevant, for example my goal and motivation. Added the
                connection between me wanting to work at HackerOne and my desire to help the world.</li>
